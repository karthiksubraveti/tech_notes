HTTP2
Http2 is a new variant of hypertext transfer protocol. It enables bidirectional streaming. 
It allows multiple streams to be fully multiplexed over a single tcp connection. 
It allows new features such as Hpack header compression, Server push, Stream prioritization 
etc and also mostly mandates TLS


Terminology 

Streams 
These are bidirectional flow of bytes within a connection. It can be used to carry one or more messages. 
Every stream is associated with an identifier and it has a priority associated with it. 

Messages
Each message corresponds to a logical request or a response. 

Frames 
This is the lowest unit of communication. Headers and data are carried by underlying http2 frames. 
Each frame contains a frame header identifying the stream it belongs to. Each frame can carry a 
specific type of data I.e HEADERS or Payload etc. also frames from various streams can be interleaved. 
The fact that various messages can be split to frames and interleaved provides a major performance 
optimization for http2 over http1

GRPC
GRPC protocols run on the top of Http2. It is used for making remote procedure calls. 
It abstracts the underlying serialization. It uses a length encoded message to pass in the request. 
It supports both unary and bidirectional streaming requests. 
The request is internally translated to a http2 post request specifying the method within the url path. 

Some quirks are
The GRPC status is received in trailers(similar to header) but it is received after fully reading the message body.
