Adding host aliases

```
The functionality you are looking for is implemented in glibc. You can define a custom hosts file by setting the HOSTALIASES environment variable. The names in this file will be picked up by gethostbyname (see documentation).

Example (tested on Ubuntu 13.10):

$ echo 'g www.google.com' >> ~/.hosts
$ export HOSTALIASES=~/.hosts
$ wget g -O /dev/null
Some limitations:

HOSTALIASES only works for applications using getaddrinfo(3) or gethostbyname(3)
For setuid/setgid/setcap applications, libc sanitizes the environment, which means that the HOSTALIASES setting is lost. ping is setuid root or is given the net_raw capability upon execution (because it needs to listen for ICMP packets), so HOSTALIASES will not work with ping unless you're already root before you call ping.
```
